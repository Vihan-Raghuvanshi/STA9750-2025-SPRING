# 🚆 Project Question  
**Has remote work reduced NYC transit ridership?**  
- 📉 Fewer commuters → Lower MTA revenue  
- 🏙 Changing work patterns → New transit needs  
- 🚇 What adjustments should MTA make?

- Tracks subway, bus, LIRR, Metro-North trends  
- Monthly station-level ridership  

### *2. U.S. Census - Remote Work Data*  
- **Source:** [ACS 5-Year Data](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT5Y2023.B08128?q=remote+worker&g=040XX00US36$8600000)  
- % of remote workers per ZIP code

# 🔍 Research Questions  
1️⃣ How much has **weekday subway ridership** declined since 2019?  
2️⃣ Do **remote-heavy neighborhoods** have bigger ridership drops?  
3️⃣ Which **subway lines & bus routes** lost the most passengers?

# 📈 Analytical Plan  
**🗂 Merge datasets**: MTA ridership + Census remote work  
**📊 Compare trends**: 2019 vs. 2023 ridership changes  
**📍 Find hotspots**: High remote work = Low transit use?  
**💰 Revenue impact**: MTA losses & future projections
